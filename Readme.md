**Machine Learning using R**

This repository contains my notes on machine learning using R in the introductory level. Topics are focusing on practical implementation of machine learning methods and are light in theory.

__Contents__

* Hands-on Machine Learning Examples
  * Use the `RColorBrewer` library to display colour pictures
  * Implement k-nearest neighbours in R by the `knn3` function of the `caret` package

Further contents to be released.
